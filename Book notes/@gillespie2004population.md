# Notes
## Chapter 1: Genetic variation

>[!example] Kreitman (1983)
>Marty Kreitman in 1983 published "Nucleotide polymorphism at the alcohol dehydrogenase *locus* of *Drosophila melanogaster*", mapping alcohol dehydrogenase (768 bp) using PCR.

Alleles can be different in multiple ways:

- **Origin:** Same *locus*, but different chromosome. This is the difference between paternal and maternal alleles.
- **Descent:** They come from different ancestors.
- **State:** Different DNA sequences, for example, mutations. 

>[!quote]
>«Diploid individuals are said to be **heterozygous** at a *locus* if the two alleles at that *locus* are different by state» (p. 8)
